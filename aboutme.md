My name is Cassandra Col&oacute;n and I recently had the honor to blaze the trail and become the first generation of college graduates in my family. It has taken many late nights, continuous breaking out of my comfort zone, and persevering effort, but I can proudly say that I have accomplished my goal. However, the trail does not end here as I continue to set new goals for myself. 

*"Never be so focused on what you're looking for that you overlook the thing you actually find.‚Äù* -Ann Patchett

In terms of career interests, the technology and finance fields have piqued my interest, however, I enjoy working wherever I can find a new challenge or work with others. I have found myself working well and thriving in many different settings, from a variety of roles in company offices, classrooms, restaurants, and on a farm. I enjoy learning new skills and finding inventive ways to adapt to my current surroundings.

### A (Somewhat) Abbreviated History

*"Home is where the heart is"* and it's safe to say my heart has taken root in many places. I was born in **Puerto Rico**, where much of my extended family still lives. I grew up in **New York City**, where my mother struggled to raise me as a single mother. I went to small Catholic school from K - 8th grade in the Lower East Side. I had the privilege of attending Concord Academy, a boarding school in **Concord, MA**. Here I forged many close connections and was exposed to a world bigger than I could have previously imagined. After, I found myself in the small city of **Meadville, PA**, where I attended Allegheny College. My time at 'Gheny was spent working toward my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Economics.
*O, Alma Mater, Beatissima*

I cannot wait to see where life's opportunities take me next.

**TL;DR** I have a variety of interests and you should get in contact me because I am open to learning more and meeting new people.
