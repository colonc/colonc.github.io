Saturday, May 12. The time had finally come. 

**Commencement.**

The day that signifies the culmination of four years at my undergraduate institution. I can hardly remember the details, the day having started early and filled with so much activity. In the blur of warm hugs, laughter, smiles, and congratulatory words, a few moments in particular really stood out. 

First, how proud my mother was to see me accomplish the goal she had wanted to so herself but was unable to. She has been present during each of my academic milestones. There was love and pride in her eyes and the excitement in her voice as she screamed my name when I walked to receive my diploma from President Mullen.

Second, truly realizing the impact I have left on others. During my time at Allegheny, I struggled to see the depth in my relationship with others. I wanted to connect deeply, but in the throes of work, group lab assignments, and trying to take care of myself, I felt as if my relationships with others took the back burner. A bit to my surprise, as I was bidding farewell to my peers, I realized the number of connections I did, in fact, make with others. This helped my last few hours on campus feel more meaningful.

Third, amongst the commencement addresses from our President and our three honorary degree recipients [John Aldrich](https://sites.duke.edu/aldrich/), [Barbara Hotham Iglewski](https://www.revolvy.com/main/index.php?s=Barbara+Iglewski), and [Carol Reardon](http://history.psu.edu/directory/car9), a particular phrase was etched into my mind: **"May we ever choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong."** While I cannot remember exactly whose voice uttered these words, after some quick research, I learned it originated from 16th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Mr. Thomas S. Monson. I'll be the first to admit that I am not particularly religious even after attending a Catholic institution for 9 years. However, these words rang true to my heart. The opportunity arises time and time again to choose an easy path versus the more difficult alternative. The easy choice can be enticing for many reasons: overall time cost, potential energy expended, momentary laziness, or simply that it's easier. Looking back at my time at Allegheny, I realized how often I was faced with this choice. I did not always choose the harder path, but when I did, I realized how much more I gained and learned in the long journey.

I believe this ideology can take me a long way through life, but I also believe in **working smarter, not harder**. Taking a long way does not mean ignoring efficient work practices and streamlined approaches.  There needs to be a balance between not cutting corners, completing the goal at hand, and going a step beyond what is expected. In taking the easier route, I miss out on the process, the opportunity to truly learn as much as I can.
